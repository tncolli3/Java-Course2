4. JUDGMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
-A software engineer proceeds with the project idea given to them by their boss, despite knowledge that the code will 
cause the computer system to malfunction and crash, possibly putting lives at danger. This practice violates the code
because the engineer did not practice integrity and independence by implementing a dangerous code suggested by their boss,against
their better judgement.

8. SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
- A software engineer fails to learn the newest dynamic programming language that their company,among others, is switching to, in order to create better
apps. This violates the code because the engineer fails to keep up with the new languages that are becoming important to the industry, therefore
not increasing their own skills which is essential to being a life long learner. 

7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues. 
-One of their colleagues writes code that creates a major bug in the project they are working on. Instead of helping or reassuring 
the colleague that mistakes happen, the engineer belittles the coder. 

1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
-A software engineer creates a virus that infects millions of computers. This violates the code by putting the information of millions in
danger and by destroying their computers, which is against the public interest. 


3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible. 
-A software engineer released a product that only worked about fifty percent of the time when used. This violates the code because a code that
works only half of the time is not at a very high standard.
